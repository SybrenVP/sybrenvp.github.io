        <h2>Hidden Through Time</h2>

        <article>
            <p>Hidden object game where you are taken through five big time ages.</p>
            <p>This was the project I started on at Rogueside. I joined the team one month before the release and was given the opportunity to learn what it takes to be part of a professional team.</p>
            <p>I helped with <span class="bold">bug fixing</span> the input system as well as porting to <span class="bold">mobile devices and tvOS</span>.</p>
                
            <p>This game became one of the most popular games made by Rogueside. It has an active playerbase and multiple DLCs were released.</p>
