        <article>
            <p>During this game jam we wanted to challenge ourselves by using unconventional controls. We used a plugin to get the gyroscope values from JoyCon. This allowed us to implement <span class="bold">Wii-style input</span>. We used perlin noise to generate a random map each time you play, which also allowed us to create an endless mode.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Component-based workflow</span> made it possible to add different types of tiles. Due to the time pressure a game jam brings, we chose to only add three types of tiles: Unusable, usable, usable with directional input.</p>
            <p>Tiles can only be held onto for a certain amount of time, this is communicated via player feedback in two different ways, you can see the hand on screen becoming red and the JoyCon will start vibrating in your hand.</p>

            <p>This game was made during the yearly 48 hour game jam of 2019 organised by Digital Arts and Entertainment. It received 2nd place. At the Game Pitch Cafe it was praised for its unique concept by multiple investors and ranked 1st amongst full scale projects.</p>
