        <h2>Warhammer 40,000: Shootas, Blood & Teef</h2>

        <article>
            <p>2D action shooter set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. The player is an Ork who is searching for his hair squig.</p>
            <p>This was a 2+ year development process that I worked on from start to finish. From networking to weapons and AI, I contributed to all aspects.</p>
            <p>The game is available on all platforms, this gave me the opportunity to expand my <span class="bold">porting skills</span> for all platforms.</p>
            <p>During the development of the game I created an interest in <span class="bold">tool development</span>. For instance, I created a tool that allowed us to create and edit 2D AI navmeshes. Most of the other tools for this project were to speed up the development pipeline. </p>
