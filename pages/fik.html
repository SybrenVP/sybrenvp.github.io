            <p>Rhythm game in which the player has to keep animals away from his campfire to survive. The theme of this gamejam was 'Mixing Genres'. We created a rhythm based survival game.</p>
            <p>This project introduced me to rhythm based game development. I created all of the <span class="bold">rhythm systems</span> which allowed the designer to quickly implement new and exciting rhythm sequences.</p>
            <p>We had a small team of three, but thanks to good <span class="bold">organisation of tasks and scope</span> we managed to create a well received game within limited time.</p>
            
            <p>This game was made during the yearly 48 hour Mix and Game jam of 2020 organised by Mix and Jam. Out of over 600 submissions, FIK ranked: 2nd place for sound, 3rd place for art and 16th place for gameplay.</p>
